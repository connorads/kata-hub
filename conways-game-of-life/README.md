# Conway's game of life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton played on a grid. Each cell is either "alive" or "dead." The game evolves based on four simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

These rules are applied simultaneously to all cells in each generation. The game continues to progress, revealing intricate patterns and structures. It's a captivating exploration of emergent behavior and the nature of life.
