# Money Problem

The Money Problem Kata involves creating a Money class that can handle different currencies and perform arithmetic operations on them. The goal is to implement a class that represents a certain amount of money in a specific currency and supports operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

To start, you need to create a Money class that has the following characteristics:

1. **Amount**: It should have a field to store the amount of money, which can be represented as a decimal or a floating-point number.

2. **Currency**: It should have a field to store the currency, which can be represented as a string (e.g., "USD", "EUR", "GBP").

The Money class should provide the following functionality:

1. **Creation**: It should allow creating a Money object by specifying the amount and currency.

2. **Addition**: It should support adding two Money objects together, resulting in a new Money object with the combined amount.

3. **Subtraction**: It should support subtracting one Money object from another, resulting in a new Money object with the difference in amount.

4. **Multiplication**: It should support multiplying a Money object by a scalar value, resulting in a new Money object with the multiplied amount.

5. **Currency Conversion**: It should provide a way to convert the amount from one currency to another, considering appropriate exchange rates.
