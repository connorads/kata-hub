# Yam

Yam is a game with simple rules. On your turn, you roll five dice. If desired, you can pick up any number of dice and roll them again. You are allowed up to two re-rolls or a total of three rolls, including the initial toss. Once you finish rolling, you assign your score to any "category" you choose.

A game of Yam consists of 13 turns. Some players enjoy playing solo to see how high they can score, while others compete against each other to achieve the highest score.

Yam offers thirteen categories where you can assign scores, one for each roll. These categories are divided into two sections. The "top" section, located on the upper half of the score card, includes Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, and Sixes. To score in these categories, you simply sum up the dice that match the respective number.

The "bottom" categories are more diverse. They include Three of a Kind and Four of a Kind. To score in either of these categories, you need three or four dice showing the same number, respectively. As long as you have the required duplicates, you sum up the values of all the dice.

Another category is Full House, which is worth 25 points. This category requires two dice showing one number and three dice showing another number.

There are also Small Straight and Large Straight categories. Small Straight requires a sequence of at least four dice, such as 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is worth 30 points. Large Straight, on the other hand, requires all five dice to be in consecutive order and is worth 40 points.

The highest-scoring category is Yam, which entails rolling five dice showing the same number. When this occurs, you can score 50 points.

If you roll more than one Yam in a game, the subsequent Yams earn a bonus of 100 points each after scoring the first one for 50 points. You must still assign these subsequent Yams to a category; if the appropriate number category is already filled, you can use it as a wildcard for any category in the bottom section, scoring it normally.

Lastly, there's a catch-all category called Chance. Here, you can score any combination by simply summing up all the dice.

You must assign each roll to one and only one category. This means that as the game progresses, it is common to "scratch" categories when you cannot achieve the required combination. A scratch results in zero points.

At the end of the game, the scores from the top and bottom sections are calculated separately. If the top section's total is greater than or equal to 63 points, a bonus of 35 points is added. The totals of the two sections are then combined to determine the overall score.
